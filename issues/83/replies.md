Hi @user,

Thank you for your interest in our project!

Unfortunately, our training code is not compatible with your current environment and device setup, so it will not run as expected in this case. However, we have already open-sourced the fine-tuning code for DiT, and since the training process for flow matching is quite similar, you can refer to that for guidance.

Additionally, we are collaborating with third-party partners who are planning to release more advanced one-click solutions for fine-tuning. These will eliminate the need for manual code debugging on your part.

Also, to clarify, the official released LoRA was trained using this code and we've tested it to ensure that it works correctly.

We hope this addresses your concerns, but feel free to let us know if you have further questions!

Best regards,  
@ChuxiJ
